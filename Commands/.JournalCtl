systemd has its own logging system called the journal; therefore, running a syslog daemon is no longer required.

journalctl -f -- New Logs 
journalctl -b -- Logs after boot up
journalctl - read systemctl log
journalctl -b 2 - show all the messages from two boots ago
journalctl --since="2012-10-30 18:17:16" - Show messages from a specific date
journalctl --since "20 min ago" - Show messages from a specific time
journalctl -f - Show new messages from now on
journalctl /usr/lib/systemd/systemd - Show messages from a specific executable
journalctl _PID=1 - Show messages by specific process
journalctl -u netcfg - Show messages by specific unit
