# ArchLinuxCustomizatios For ASUS UX 305 Ultrabook
1. Add the openbox folder inside your .config folder
2. Add the AppConfig folder inside your home folder
3. Add the Commands folder inside your home folder and rename it to .Commands
4. Add the Scripts folder into your home folder.

These changes will give you a menue and pre-defined configs to your openbox environment.

Command folder contains some commands which you can use with in bash. So you dont want to remember linux commands. To dispay those
use cat .Commands/SomeCommandFile instead.

Scripts folder contains some scripts you can use.


ENJOY.
